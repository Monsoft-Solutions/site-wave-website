  content: `# Website Redesign Checklist: Is It Time for an Upgrade?

Your website is your digital storefront, your 24/7 salesperson, and often the first impression potential customers have of your Southwest Florida business. But how do you know when it's time to invest in a redesign?

If you're wondering whether your current website is helping or hurting your business, you're not alone. Many business owners in Cape Coral, Fort Myers, and Naples struggle with this decision. The good news? There are clear signs that indicate when a website redesign will provide real ROI.

## The Digital Shelf Life of a Website

Just like physical storefronts need periodic updates, websites have a digital shelf life. In today's fast-paced digital world, a website that was cutting-edge three years ago might now look outdated and perform poorly.

**Industry standards suggest:**
- Consumer-facing websites should be refreshed every 2-3 years
- B2B websites can last 3-4 years before needing updates
- E-commerce sites need more frequent updates due to changing user expectations

However, these are just guidelines. The real question is: **Is your website serving your business goals?**
