# Phase 1: Authentication & Authorization Setup - COMPLETED ✅

## Overview

Phase 1 of the admin area implementation has been successfully completed! This phase focused on setting up Better Auth authentication system with database integration and route protection.

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ 1. Better Auth Dependencies Installation

- Installed `better-auth` and `@better-fetch/fetch`
- All dependencies successfully added to the project

### ✅ 2. Environment Configuration

- Updated `lib/env.ts` to include Better Auth configuration variables
- Added `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and `BETTER_AUTH_URL` to environment schema
- Updated `.env.example` with Better Auth configuration

### ✅ 3. Database Schema Setup

- Created comprehensive auth-related database tables:
  - `users` - User accounts with role-based access control
  - `sessions` - User session management
  - `accounts` - OAuth provider accounts
  - `verification_tokens` - Email verification tokens
  - `admin_activity_logs` - Admin action audit trail
- Created auth-related enums for roles and actions
- Set up proper database relations between all tables

### ✅ 4. Database Migration & Seeding

- Generated and executed migration for auth tables
- Created admin user seed operation
- Successfully seeded initial admin user:
  - **Email**: admin@site-wave.com
  - **Name**: Site Wave Admin
  - **Role**: admin
  - **Email Verified**: true

### ✅ 5. Better Auth Configuration

- Set up main auth configuration in `lib/auth/auth.ts`
- Configured Drizzle adapter for PostgreSQL
- Enabled email/password authentication
- Set up session management with proper security settings
- Integrated `nextCookies` plugin for server actions

### ✅ 6. Auth Client Setup

- Created auth client in `lib/auth/client.ts`
- Exported necessary hooks and methods for React components
- Configured for Next.js app router

### ✅ 7. API Routes

- Created Better Auth API handler at `/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`
- Handles all authentication endpoints automatically

### ✅ 8. TypeScript Types & Utilities

- Created comprehensive auth types in `lib/types/auth.type.ts`
- Built role-based permission system in `lib/utils/auth.util.ts`
- Defined user roles: `user`, `viewer`, `editor`, `admin`
- Created permission helpers and validation functions

### ✅ 9. Middleware Protection

- Implemented Next.js middleware for protecting `/admin/*` routes
- Uses Better Auth session cookies for authentication checks
- Redirects unauthenticated users to sign-in page

### ✅ 10. Authentication Pages

- Created sign-in page at `/app/auth/signin/page.tsx`
- Built with modern UI using Shadcn components
- Includes error handling and loading states
- Created Alert component for error messages

### ✅ 11. Admin Dashboard

- Created basic admin dashboard at `/app/admin/page.tsx`
- Shows authenticated user information
- Displays implementation progress
- Includes sign-out functionality
- Preview of upcoming features for future phases

## Technical Architecture

### Database Tables Created

```sql
- users (auth users with roles)
- sessions (user sessions)
- accounts (OAuth accounts)
- verification_tokens (email verification)
- admin_activity_logs (audit trail)
```

### User Roles System

- **user**: Basic user with no admin access
- **viewer**: Can view analytics only
- **editor**: Can manage content (blog posts, services)
- **admin**: Full system access

### File Structure Added

middleware.ts                   # Route protection
```

## How to Use

### 1. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with:

```env
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your-secret-here"
BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
```

### 2. Admin Access

The seeded admin user needs to set a password through Better Auth's password reset system since passwords can't be set directly in the seed.

### 3. Test Authentication

1. Navigate to `/admin` - you'll be redirected to sign-in
2. Use the sign-in page at `/auth/signin`
3. After authentication, you'll have access to the admin dashboard

## Security Features

- ✅ Session-based authentication with secure cookies
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ✅ Route protection via middleware
- ✅ Password security handled by Better Auth
- ✅ Email verification support
- ✅ Activity logging for admin actions
- ✅ Type-safe auth operations

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

With Phase 1 complete, the foundation is ready for Phase 2:

- Admin layout with responsive sidebar
- Navigation structure
- Dashboard with key metrics
- Mobile-responsive design
